Uber Clone - README.md
Welcome to the Uber Clone project! This is a modern, full-stack application mimicking Uber’s core functionality—ride booking for users and driving for captains. Whether you’re a passenger looking for a ride or a driver ready to hit the road, this app has you covered. Built with a sleek frontend, secure authentication, and role-based dashboards, it’s a great starting point for learning or building your own ride-sharing platform.

This README is your guide to understanding the project, setting it up, and exploring its features. Think of it as a modern school jewel—a shiny, detailed tutorial to help you navigate the code with ease!

Features
User Authentication: Sign up and log in as a regular user to book rides.
Captain Authentication: Register and log in as a captain to manage driving tasks.
Role-Based Dashboards: Separate dashboards for users and captains, secured with protected routes.
Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly navigation with a sleek hamburger menu.
Modern UI: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, Uber-like look and feel.
Video Backgrounds: Engaging login pages with looping video illustrations.
Social Login Placeholders: Buttons for GitHub, Twitter, and Facebook (ready for OAuth integration).
Tech Stack
Here’s the toolkit powering this Uber clone, with examples of how each piece fits in:

React: The core library for building dynamic, component-based UIs.
Example: <UserLoginPage /> uses React hooks like useState and useContext to manage form state.
React Router: Handles navigation and routing for a single-page app experience.
Example: <Route path="/dashboard" element={<ProtectedRoute><Dashboard /></ProtectedRoute>} /> secures the user dashboard.
Axios: Makes HTTP requests to your backend API for authentication and data.
Example: axios.post('/user/user-login', loginFormData) logs users in.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for fast, responsive styling.
Example: className="bg-black text-white px-6 py-2" styles the header.
Lucide React: Lightweight, customizable icons for a modern UI.
Example: <Menu /> and <X /> toggle the mobile navigation.
Vite (Assumed): A fast build tool for modern JavaScript apps (assumed from import.meta.env usage).
Example: ${import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API_URL}/captain/register fetches the API base URL from .env.

Setup Instructions
Get the app running on your machine in a few simple steps:

Clone the Repository:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-clone.git
cd uber-clone
Install Dependencies:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm install
Includes: react, react-router-dom, axios, tailwindcss, lucide-react.
Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add your backend API URL:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
VITE_BASE_API_URL=http://your-backend-api.com/api
Replace with your actual API URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000/api for local dev).
Run the App:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173 (or your Vite port) in your browser.
Backend Setup:
This assumes a backend with endpoints like /user/sign-up, /captain/register, etc. Set up a Node.js/Express server or similar if not already done.
How It Works
Here’s a breakdown of the app’s flow, with tech examples to make it crystal clear.

User Flow
Sign Up: Go to /user-signup, enter your details (e.g., FirstName, email), and submit. Axios sends this to /user/sign-up, storing a token in localStorage.
Log In: At /user-login, enter credentials. handleLogin from AuthContext authenticates you and redirects to /dashboard.
Dashboard: Access /dashboard—ProtectedRoute checks token and renders <Dashboard />.
Captain Flow
Register: Visit /captain-registration, fill out captain and vehicle info (e.g., vehicle.color). handleCaptainSignup hits /captain/register, saving captaintoken.
Log In: At /captain-login, log in with email/password. handleCaptainLogin redirects to /captain-dashboard.
Dashboard: /captain-dashboard is captain-only (captainOnly={true} in ProtectedRoute), showing captain-specific content.
Authentication
AuthContext: Manages state (loginFormData, captainSignupFormData) and handlers (handleLogin, handleLogout) using React Context.
Example: useAuth() in <UserLoginPage /> accesses form data and submits it.
ProtectedRoute: Secures routes by checking token or captaintoken.
Example: <ProtectedRoute captainOnly={true}><CaptainDashboard /></ProtectedRoute> ensures only captains access.
Examples
Here’s how key parts come together:

User Login Form
jsx

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
// User_Login.jsx
const { loginFormData, handleLoginChange, handleLogin } = useAuth();
<input
    name="email"
    value={loginFormData.email}
    onChange={handleLoginChange}
    type="email"
    placeholder="Email"
/>
<button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
Protected Captain Dashboard
jsx

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
// App.jsx
<Route
    path="/captain-dashboard"
    element={
        <ProtectedRoute captainOnly={true}>
            <CaptainDashboard />
        </ProtectedRoute>
    }
/>
API Call in Context
jsx

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
// AuthContext.jsx
const handleSignup = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const response = await axios.post(
        `${import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API_URL}/user/sign-up`,
        signupFormData
    );
    localStorage.setItem('token', response.data.user.token);
    navigate('/dashboard');
};
